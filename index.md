## Design [Figma]

I'm not a designer, I don't really know what I'm doing, so I try following what I like: clean and simple user interfaces.

The pages use simple components, nothing is too complex since I want to build everything from scratch without using a components library. I'm not an experienced software engineer, so building and maintaining a project by my self is already plenty of work.

One could say that the color palette is boring, they wouldn't be wrong. I don't know how to play with colors, I know there is a lot going on here but to avoid loosing focus on what really matters (building the software) I made this decision. I chose this palette using [coolors](https://coolors.co/), so I know I'm not completely wrong with this combination.

Currently there is only a light theme (I think it is easier to make), but one of my goals is to provide a dark theme in the future.
