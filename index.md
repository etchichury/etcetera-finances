# Manage and keep track of your budget.

## Description

This is a personal project, and made for my use cases. I always noticed that I wanted a way to see what I'm doing with my money and where it is going every month. This product will help me visualize and make decisions based on that.

There is quite a lot I want to do in this project, but I will try to be as simple as I can, at least for the first MVP. I know that one of the reasons a lot of personal projects dies is due to they being too complex and neverending, so I have to whatch out for this.
You can check the [Features](features.md) section to see the list.

Etcetera is composed by to main components: the [React frontend](https://github.com/etchichury/etcetera-finances/) and the FastAPI backend (TBD). This documentation will have information about both of them.
## Design [Figma]

I'm not a designer, I don't really know what I'm doing, so I try following what I like: clean and simple user interfaces.

The pages use simple components, nothing is too complex since I want to build everything from scratch without using a components library. I'm not an experienced software engineer, so building and maintaining a project by my self is already plenty of work.

One could say that the color palette is boring, they wouldn't be wrong. I don't know how to play with colors, I know there is a lot going on here but to avoid loosing focus on what really matters (building the software) I made this decision. I chose this palette using [coolors](https://coolors.co/), so I know I'm not completely wrong with this combination.

Currently there is only a light theme (I think it is easier to make), but one of my goals is to provide a dark theme in the future.
